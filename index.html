                <p>Unless if you have been living under a rock you have probably heard the quote, “Knowledge is Power”, That is truer than you can ever imagine. Not many people know how important knowledge is.  Knowledge is the reason we are where we are today, without knowledge they would be no cars and we would still be riding horses or sending letters instead of emails. The reason we have accomplished all of this is because of the ability to understand and interpret information, and without fluency skills, there is no way we could have accomplished all of this. That is why fluency skills are essential and why it is crucial that every student is information literate</p>

                     <h1>Information fluency</h1>
                     <p>Information Fluency is the ability to unconsciously and intuitively interpret information so you can extract essential information and understand its meaning and its significance, and you can then apply the knowledge you gained to real world. According to Crockett (2015,8) There is a lot of information on the internet. With new information being added every second, and because of this, crucial information gets obsolete far quicker than we can keep up, making it hard to find relevant information with knowledge built on those facts becoming less durable. Due to the rapid increase of information being added on the internet, unless information also increases. With this in mind, information fluency will help to determine the credibility, authenticity, and veracity of the information presented.

                    <h1>Solution fluency</h1>
                    <p>Solution fluency is all about finding creative ways to solve a problem presented to us. But we have to follow certain steps before we can come up with the best solution, and the steps include gathering facts and considering the challenge from multiple perspectives, interpreting information so we can know exactly what it is that we need, and where to begin in order to a find a solution to the problem we are facing. Doing this is a way for students to learn good problem-solving skills and to become successful with any challenge in the future. This ensures deeper thinking and enhances student’s ability to understand a problem before solving it.</p>

                    <p>Collaboration Fluency is the ability to work with a team efficiently with mutual assistance in working towards a common goal with virtual and real partners in online environments to create an original product. I think we can agree now more than ever that collaborating and communicating digitally is more important we can imagine, a simple COVID can bring everything to a standstill. That is why is it important that students mastered the skill of collaboration as well as being digitally literate and understand the effectiveness of collaboration fluency, by being collaboration fluency every person around the world can communicate and working together. Collaborating digitally provides a seamless experience and it enables students to develop effective self-directed learning skills and with this, they can identify what they need to learn, find and use online resources, apply the information on the problem at hand, and even evaluate resultant feedback

                   <p>According to Crockett (2015,8) media fluency is the ability to listen and pay attention towards any communication taking place and be able to interpret the message and direct that message to the intended audience. As technology advances daily, it is crucial that students learn media, this will shape their understanding of how media affects society. They also learn why Media Fluency is essential in the digital age. Media fluency helps students learn to think critically. As they evaluate media, they decide whether the information presented in front of them makes sense or not,  and if it is accurate or not and by doing this they can make up their own minds about the information based on the knowledge they already have</p>
