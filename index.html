                <h1 class="title">The importance of fluency skills</h1>
                <p>You have probably heard the old quote, “Knowledge is Power,” That’s truer than you can ever imagine. 
                    Few people understand how important knowledge can be. Knowledge is what allows us to drive cars 
                    instead of ride horses, it is what helps us survive far longer than we should, and knowledge is even what prevents us 
                    from making the same mistakes we made in the past. But all of this comes down to one thing, the ability to 
                    understand and interpret information, without fluency skills there is no way we can fully understand information 
                    and solve problems presented to us. Essentially, we need information fluency in order to be able to find solutions 
                    to the problems presented. 
                    In other words, solution fluency is built on information fluency.</p>

                     <p>Information Fluency is the “ability to unconsciously and 
                        intuitively interpret information in all forms and formats in 
                        order to extract the essential knowledge, perceive its meaning 
                        and significance, and use it to complete real-world tasks” 
                        (Churches, Jukes & Crockett, 2011: 33).

                            According to Crockett( 2015,8) There is a lot of information 
                            on the internet. With new information being added every 
                            second, and because of this information gets obsolete far 
                            quicker than we can keep up making it hard to find relevant 
                            with the knowledge built on those facts becoming less 
                            durable. Due to the rapid increase of information being 
                            added on the internet unless information also increases. 
                            information fluency as a process will help to determine the 
                            credibility, authenticity, and veracity of the information 
                            presented.
